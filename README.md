# Environment Variable

## LAWEASYREAD\_COV
The `LAWEASYREAD_COV` is used to indicate that we are generating coverage report
now. In this case, we need to require different source to do so. The coverage
source is generated by [jscoverage](https://npmjs.org/package/jscoverage) in
[test.js](https://github.com/g0v/laweasyread/blob/master/test.js). The path of
coverage code is `lib-cov`. To require correct `lib` or `lib-cov`, you need to
require root directory, and then index.js in root directory will require the
correct one for you.

# Unit Test

    npm test

Use the following command to generate coverage report
