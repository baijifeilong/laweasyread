# Environment Variable

## LAWEASYREAD\_COV
The `LAWEASYREAD_COV` is used to indicate that we are generating coverage report
now. In this case, we need to require different source to do so. The coverage
source is generated by [jscoverage](https://npmjs.org/package/jscoverage) in
[test.js](https://github.com/g0v/laweasyread/blob/master/test.js). The path of
coverage code is appended with `-cov` suffix. So in source code, if we need to
generating coverage report, we need to require the right source for it. The
following is one example to do so:

    libpath = if process.env.LAWEASYREAD_COV => \../lib-cov/ else \../lib/
    parse = require libpath + \parse

# Unit Test
Use the following command to run unit test for this package

    npm test

Use the following command to generate coverage report

    node test.js --coverage > report.html
